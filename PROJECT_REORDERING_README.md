# Project Reordering Feature

## Overview
The Task Management application now supports drag-and-drop reordering of projects in the main table view. Users can easily rearrange projects by dragging them up or down using the new drag handle column.

## Features

### Drag and Drop Reordering
- **Drag Handle**: A new column with a bars icon (☰) appears on the left side of each project row
- **Visual Feedback**: Projects become semi-transparent and show a shadow while being dragged
- **Smooth Animation**: Smooth transitions during drag operations
- **Intuitive Controls**: Click and drag the bars icon to reorder projects

### How to Use

1. **Locate the Drag Handle**: Look for the ☰ icon in the leftmost column of each project row
2. **Click and Drag**: Click on the bars icon and drag the project up or down
3. **Drop**: Release the mouse button to drop the project in its new position
4. **Visual Feedback**: The project will smoothly animate to its new position

### Technical Implementation

#### Components Added
- `SortableProjectRow.js` - Wraps the existing ProjectRow with drag-and-drop functionality
- Uses `@dnd-kit` library for smooth drag-and-drop operations
- Integrates with the existing table structure

#### Key Features
- **Collision Detection**: Uses `closestCenter` for accurate drop detection
- **Sorting Strategy**: Implements `verticalListSortingStrategy` for vertical reordering
- **State Management**: Automatically updates the tasks array when projects are reordered
- **Performance**: Efficient reordering without unnecessary re-renders

#### Dependencies
- `@dnd-kit/core` - Core drag-and-drop functionality
- `@dnd-kit/sortable` - Sorting-specific drag-and-drop features
- `@dnd-kit/utilities` - Utility functions for transforms and styling

### Styling
- Drag handle uses `Bars3Icon` from Heroicons
- Hover effects with background color changes
- Smooth transitions for all interactions
- Visual feedback during drag operations

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Touch devices supported through pointer events
- Fallback gracefully for older browsers

## Usage Examples

### Basic Reordering
```javascript
// Projects can be reordered by dragging
// The order is automatically saved in the component state
```

### Custom Styling
```css
/* Drag handle styling can be customized */
.drag-handle {
  cursor: grab;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.drag-handle:active {
  cursor: grabbing;
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Save reorder preferences to localStorage
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add animation for bulk reordering operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Drag not working**: Ensure the project is not in edit mode
2. **Visual glitches**: Check if CSS transitions are enabled
3. **Performance issues**: Verify that the tasks array is not too large

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging to debug drag-and-drop operations:
```javascript
// Add to handleProjectDragEnd function
console.log('Drag ended:', { active, over, oldIndex, newIndex });
```

## Contributing
When modifying the reordering functionality:
1. Maintain the existing drag-and-drop API
2. Test with various project configurations
3. Ensure accessibility standards are met
4. Update this documentation for any changes
