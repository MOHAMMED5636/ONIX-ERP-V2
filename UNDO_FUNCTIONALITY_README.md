# Undo Functionality for Project and Task Deletion

## Overview
The Undo functionality provides a comprehensive solution for recovering accidentally deleted projects and tasks in the ERP system. It implements soft deletion with a 5-second undo window, ensuring users can recover their work if they delete something by mistake.

## ✅ **Requirements Implemented**

### 1. **Soft Delete Implementation**
- ✅ Items are not permanently removed when deleted
- ✅ Uses `is_deleted = true` flag to mark items as deleted
- ✅ Adds `deleted_at` timestamp for tracking deletion time
- ✅ Items remain in the system but are hidden from the UI

### 2. **Toast Notification with Undo Button**
- ✅ Shows toast notification immediately after deletion
- ✅ Displays item count and type (project/task/subtask)
- ✅ Prominent "Undo" button for easy access
- ✅ Progress bar showing remaining time (5 seconds)
- ✅ Pauses countdown when user hovers over toast

### 3. **Undo Restoration**
- ✅ Clicking "Undo" restores the deleted item (`is_deleted = false`)
- ✅ UI refreshes automatically to show restored items
- ✅ Works for both individual and bulk deletions
- ✅ Maintains all item properties and relationships

### 4. **Auto-commit After 5 Seconds**
- ✅ If undo is not clicked within 5 seconds, deletion is committed
- ✅ Items remain soft-deleted (can be implemented for permanent deletion later)
- ✅ Toast automatically disappears after timeout

### 5. **Consistent with Copy/Paste Logic**
- ✅ Follows same patterns as existing copy/paste functionality
- ✅ Maintains selection state consistency
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing bulk operations

### 6. **Works for Both Projects and Tasks**
- ✅ Handles individual project deletion
- ✅ Handles individual subtask deletion
- ✅ Handles bulk project deletion
- ✅ Handles bulk subtask deletion
- ✅ Handles mixed selections (projects + subtasks)

### 7. **Modular and Reusable**
- ✅ `UndoToast` component can be reused in other modules
- ✅ `useUndoManager` hook provides reusable undo logic
- ✅ `softDeleteUtils` utility functions for consistent soft delete operations
- ✅ Easy to integrate into other parts of the system

## **Integration**

### **MainTable.js Integration**
The MainTable component has been updated with:

1. **Import Statements**:
   ```javascript
   import UndoToast from '../common/UndoToast';
   import useUndoManager from '../../hooks/useUndoManager';
   import { filterActiveItems, applySoftDelete, applyRestore } from '../../utils/softDeleteUtils';
   ```

2. **Undo Manager Hook**:
   ```javascript
   const undoManager = useUndoManager();
   ```

3. **Updated Delete Functions**:
   - `handleDeleteRow()` - Individual deletion with undo
   - `handleBulkDelete()` - Bulk deletion with undo
   - `handleUndoRestore()` - Restoration logic

4. **UI Filtering**:
   - Tasks filtered to exclude soft-deleted items
   - Subtasks filtered to exclude soft-deleted items
   - Maintains existing filtering and sorting

5. **Toast Component**:
   - Added at the end of the component
   - Connected to undo manager state
   - Handles undo and dismiss actions

## **Usage Examples**

### **Individual Project Deletion**
```javascript
// User clicks delete button on a project
handleDeleteRow(projectId);
// → Project marked as is_deleted: true
// → Toast appears: "Project 'Website Development' deleted"
// → User has 5 seconds to click Undo
```

### **Bulk Deletion**
```javascript
// User selects multiple projects and clicks bulk delete
handleBulkDelete(selectedProjects, selectedSubtasks);
// → All selected items marked as is_deleted: true
// → Toast appears: "3 projects deleted"
// → User has 5 seconds to click Undo
```

### **Undo Operation**
```javascript
// User clicks Undo button
undoManager.undoDeletion(handleUndoRestore);
// → All deleted items marked as is_deleted: false
// → Toast disappears
// → Items reappear in the UI
```

## **Data Structure Changes**

### **Task/Project Object**
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Website Development",
  // ... other properties
  is_deleted: false,        // NEW: Soft delete flag
  deleted_at: null          // NEW: Deletion timestamp
}
```

### **Soft-Deleted Item**
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Website Development",
  // ... other properties
  is_deleted: true,         // Marked as deleted
  deleted_at: 1640995200000 // Timestamp when deleted
}
```

## **Key Features**

### **Visual Feedback**
- **Toast Animation**: Smooth slide-up animation
- **Progress Bar**: Visual countdown timer
- **Hover Effect**: Pauses timer when hovering
- **Color Coding**: Orange theme for delete operations

### **User Experience**
- **Non-Intrusive**: Toast appears in bottom-right corner
- **Clear Messaging**: Shows exactly what was deleted
- **Easy Access**: Large, prominent Undo button
- **Quick Dismiss**: X button to close immediately

### **Performance**
- **Efficient Filtering**: Only filters on render, not on every state change
- **Memory Management**: Cleans up timeouts on unmount
- **Optimized Updates**: Uses React's state batching

### **Accessibility**
- **Keyboard Support**: All buttons are keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Maintains focus after operations

## **Reusability**

### **In Other Components**
To use the undo functionality in other components:

1. **Import the hook and component**:
   ```javascript
   import useUndoManager from '../hooks/useUndoManager';
   import UndoToast from '../common/UndoToast';
   ```

2. **Add the hook**:
   ```javascript
   const undoManager = useUndoManager();
   ```

3. **Use in delete operations**:
   ```javascript
   const handleDelete = (item) => {
     // Soft delete the item
     undoManager.softDeleteItems([item], setItems, 'item', `${item.name} deleted`);
   };
   ```

4. **Add the toast component**:
   ```javascript
   <UndoToast
     isVisible={undoManager.undoState.isVisible}
     onUndo={() => undoManager.undoDeletion(handleRestore)}
     onDismiss={undoManager.dismissUndoToast}
     message={undoManager.undoState.message}
     itemType={undoManager.undoState.itemType}
     count={undoManager.undoState.deletedItems.length}
   />
   ```

## **Future Enhancements**

### **Potential Improvements**
- **Permanent Deletion**: Add option to permanently delete after soft delete
- **Batch Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of old soft-deleted items
- **Admin Panel**: Interface for managing soft-deleted items
- **Audit Trail**: Track who deleted what and when
- **Custom Durations**: Allow different undo timeouts for different item types

### **Database Integration**
- **Backend API**: Connect to backend for persistent soft delete
- **Sync**: Keep frontend and backend in sync
- **Recovery**: Admin interface to recover accidentally deleted items
